                    This is local housing in Singapore managed by the
                    Housing and Development Board (HDB). The majority of the residential housing developments in
                    Singapore are publicly governed and developed and home to approximately 78.7% of the resident
                    population. These flats are located in housing estates which are self-contained satellite towns with
                    well-maintained schools, supermarkets, malls, community hospitals, clinics, food courts and sports
                    and recreational facilities. Every housing estate includes MRT stations and bus stops that link
                    residents to other parts of the city-state. Some estates are also complemented by smaller LRT
                    stations which act as feed service to the MRT.

                    <br><br>
                    Condominiums, cluster housing and landed houses fall under this category of housing type. Most
                    condos and cluster housing would have facilities. Location/districts of the private housing is the
                    main factor of the rental prices. In addition, the location of an international school, the rent
                    tends to be higher in popular expat areas where the children might attend one of the many
                    international schools in Singapore.

                    <br><br>
                    The condominium is one of the most common type of private estate in Singapore. Compared to public
                    housing, it is recognised by its provision of common facilities such as private swimming pools,
                    tennis courts, gym and the presence of security guards on duty. Basement parking space are available
                    for both residents and visitors, parking space falls under the management fee that is paid by the
                    Owner. Depending on the size of developments. Low density developments may just have pool and gym,
                    average/mid density developments would have pool, gym, children playground and tennis and high
                    density developments would have added facilities like mini-mart, hair salon, badminton court, 50m
                    lap pool etc.. Condominiums are available in all districts. Hence, this gives good options for the
                    tenant to look for suitable homes that would match with the requirement and budget.

                    <br><br>
                    Cluster houses in Singapore is a bit of a hybrid, combining the privacy and spaciousness of landed
                    properties, with the convenience of condo facilities such as swimming pools and gyms. Cluster houses
                    represent a growing market in Singapore, particularly with families after a bit more space, but
                    without the maintenance hassle. Typically, it is built three storeys with a roof terrace and
                    basement. Each unit minimum one or two private parking spaces.

                    A terrace house is a dwelling house with its own land title that forms part of a row of at least 3
                    welling houses abutting the common boundary party walls. Terrace houses can be built in designated
                    mixed landed housing areas, if the development site area meets the minimum plot size and width
                    requirements. Landed houses in Singapore has no facilities. It is usually Tenant’s responsibility to
                    take care of the garden (if it has garden space)

                    This is short for semi-detached and refers to a house which is joined on one side to another
                    property. Two homes sharing a common wall make up one building. Originally they are mirror images of
                    each other in layout and facade. Semi-detached houses are usually called “semi-d” here. In other
                    countries, they are identified as duplex. Corner terrace houses are also considered semi-detached
                    houses as they share only one party wall. The land space is generally bigger than Terrace houses,
                    hence, there will be garden space and/or built in lap pool which falls under the Tenant’s
                    responsibility to maintain.

                    stories high but occasionally it consists of three floors. Some are extremely large with built up
                    areas exceeding 10,000 square feet. The land space is generally bigger than semi-detached houses,
                    hence, there will be large garden space and/or built in sizeable pool which falls under the Tenant’s

                    Good Class Bungalow, or GCB, is the most luxurious type of landed residence. According to government
                    guidelines on landed housing, GCBs must have a minimum land area (also called plot size) of 1,400sqm
                    (15,070sqft). Built-up size is usually 10,000sqft, with space for a car porch for 3-4 cars, a
                    swimming pool and garden. GCBs are designated within the prime residential districts 10 (for
                    example: Nassim Road, Cluny Road), 11 (Eng Neo Avenue, Swiss Club Road) and popular districts 21
                    (Binjai Park) and 23 (Chestnut Avenue).

                    Colonial bungalows (also fondly known as black-and-white houses) that are not big enough to be GCBs,
                    or not located in designated GCB districts, are also considered detached houses. Singapore's black
                    and white houses are colonial bungalows built between the late 19th century up until the pre-war era
                    of the 1930s. They get their name from the dark timber beams and whitewashed walls that were
                    prevalent in their construction. The black and white houses were originally built by British
                    colonial families. The design, sometimes referred to as Tudorbethan Style, combines tropical and art
                    deco elements with a traditional Victorian style home. Inspired by the Malay practice of building
                    homes on stilts, the black and white houses sit on elevated platforms – this was popular with
                    British expats who wanted to distance themselves from dangerous tropical insects and also alleviated
                    concerns about flooding during the rainy season. Other elements that are characteristic of the black
                    and white houses are large verandas and overhanging roofs. The houses were designed with high
                    ceilings, shutter-style windows and open-concept layouts in order to amplify any breeze that passed
                    through the house. These homes continue to be very popular, especially among British and other expat
                    families, despite sometimes having a dark past. For example, the Black and White houses in Adam Park
                    were used as POW camps during WWII. Regardless, their scarcity and extravagance keep them in high
                    demand. Rentals are available for some of these properties and start around $5,000/month on the low
                    end and can go as high as $35,000/month for high-end properties in central locations
